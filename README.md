# What it does?

* Dynamic Content Monitoring: Utilizes a MutationObserver to continuously watch for changes in the DOM, guaranteeing that fixes are re-applied even when content or styles are dynamically loaded or altered by other scripts.
* Comprehensive Console Reporting: Provides detailed logs in the browser's developer console, categorizing issues by severity (Critical, Moderate, Minor, Info) and indicating which issues were successfully auto-fixed. It also offers recommendations and references relevant WCAG guidelines.
* Improved User Experience: Aims to make web content more usable and perceivable for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
